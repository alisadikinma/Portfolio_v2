## üîß Configuration

Configuration is in `playwright.config.js`:

- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds per test
- **Retries:** 2 (in CI), 0 (locally)
- **Screenshot:** On failure only
- **Video:** Retained on failure
- **Browsers:** Chromium, Firefox, Webkit
- **Devices:** Desktop, Tablet, Mobile (iPhone, Pixel)

## üìù Writing Tests

### Test Structure (AAA Pattern)

```javascript
test('should display homepage', async ({ page }) => {
  // Arrange
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  
  // Act
  const heading = page.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 });
  
  // Assert
  await expect(heading).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Using Data Test IDs

Always prefer `data-testid` attributes for reliable selectors:

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good - Stable selector
const button = page.locator('[data-testid="submit-button"]');

// ‚ùå Avoid - Fragile selector
const button = page.locator('.btn-primary.large');
```

### Waiting for Network Requests

```javascript
// Wait for page to be fully loaded
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

// Wait for specific API call
await page.waitForResponse(response => 
  response.url().includes('/api/projects') && response.status() === 200
);
```

### Taking Screenshots

```javascript
// Full page screenshot
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/page.png', fullPage: true });

// Element screenshot
await element.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/element.png' });

// Screenshot with clip
await page.screenshot({ 
  path: 'screenshots/section.png',
  clip: { x: 0, y: 0, width: 1920, height: 400 }
});
```

## üêõ Debugging Tests

### Debug in UI Mode (Recommended)
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Debug Specific Test
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
npx playwright test 01-homepage --debug
```

### Show Browser During Test
```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Slow Down Test Execution
```bash
npx playwright test --headed --slow-mo=1000
```

### Use Playwright Inspector
```javascript
await page.pause(); // Pauses execution and opens inspector
```

## üì± Testing on Different Viewports

Tests automatically run on multiple viewports (configured in `playwright.config.js`):

- **Desktop:** 1920x1080
- **Tablet:** 1024x1366 (iPad Pro)
- **Mobile:** 375x667 (iPhone 13), 412x915 (Pixel 5)

To test specific viewport:
```javascript
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 768, height: 1024 });
```

## ‚ôø Accessibility Testing

Built-in accessibility checks:
- Alt text on images
- Proper heading hierarchy (one h1)
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels
- Focus states

For comprehensive accessibility audit, consider using:
```bash
npm install -D @axe-core/playwright
```

## üîç Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use `data-testid` attributes for critical elements
- Wait for `networkidle` before assertions
- Take screenshots on important steps
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests in `describe` blocks
- Test both happy path and error states

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Use hardcoded waits (`waitForTimeout`) unless necessary
- Depend on CSS classes that might change
- Test implementation details
- Make tests depend on each other
- Ignore flaky tests

## üìä CI/CD Integration

For GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/playwright.yml
name: Playwright Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Run tests
        run: npx playwright test
      - name: Upload report
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

## üé® Visual Testing Workflow

### Initial Setup (Week 7)
1. **Create baseline screenshots:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test visual --update-snapshots
   ```

2. **Commit baseline screenshots to git:**
   ```bash
   git add tests/**/*.spec.js-snapshots/
   git commit -m "Add baseline visual snapshots"
   ```

### Regular Development
1. **Run visual tests:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test visual
   ```

2. **Review differences:**
   - Open `playwright-report/index.html`
   - Check visual diffs
   - Determine if changes are intentional

3. **If changes are intentional:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test visual --update-snapshots
   git add tests/**/*.spec.js-snapshots/
   git commit -m "Update visual snapshots"
   ```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing Locally But Pass in CI
- Check viewport size differences
- Ensure consistent font rendering
- Disable animations: `animations: 'disabled'`

### Flaky Tests
- Add proper waits: `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
- Use `waitForSelector` with timeout
- Retry failed tests: configured in `playwright.config.js`

### Screenshots Don't Match
- Fonts may differ between OS
- Use consistent docker image for CI
- Increase visual diff threshold if needed

### Can't Find Elements
- Check if page is fully loaded
- Use Playwright Inspector: `await page.pause()`
- Try different selectors: role, text, testid
