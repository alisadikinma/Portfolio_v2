## 🎯 Phase 9: Gallery System Restructure

**Start Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Estimated Duration:** 180-240 minutes  
**Complexity:** HIGH (Database restructure + DROP 3 tables)  
**Prompts:**
- Main: `.claude/prompts/phase-9_gallery-restructure_20251025.md`
- Migration: `.claude/prompts/phase-9_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md` ⚠️ **Read this first!**

### Problem Statement
Gallery system salah konsep:
- ❌ `galleries` standalone single image (no relationships)
- ❌ `gallery_groups` + `gallery_items` (wrong structure, items → groups)
- ❌ `award_gallery_groups` pivot (many-to-many wrong)
- ❌ `awards.featured_gallery_group_id` FK (wrong concept)
- ❌ Missing: company, period, thumbnail, award_id di galleries

### Solution
- ✅ DROP: `gallery_groups`, `gallery_items` (old), `award_gallery_groups`
- ✅ Gallery = Container (company, period, thumbnail, award_id)
- ✅ Gallery Items = Multiple images/videos per gallery (NEW table)
- ✅ Award → Gallery = One-to-Many (optional)
